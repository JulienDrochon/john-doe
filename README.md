This website is a single HTML file. It simply uses the `#anchor` suffix (from 1992) and the `:target` CSS selector to show and hide pages/content. This setup is databaseless, javascriptless, and buildshit-free, so you can edit your website with a text editor and upload it somewhere like a normal person.
